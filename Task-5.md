# Introdcution
Vsd squdron mini provided me with an opportunity to learn and gain experience in building programs,circuits and chip designs.
Using, this opportunity I build an auotmatic L.P.G gas detector using vsd-squadron and  minimal components for cheap and reliable usasge in every home.

# Pins used:
1) Taking 5 V pin as common vcc.
2) Then taking ground pin(gnd) as common ground.
3) Give the MQ-6 sensor vcc and gnd, from common source ,then connect PC4 pin to the digital (d/o) output of the MQ-6 sensor.
4) Using the PD6 pin , we connect it to the L.E.D for turning it on/off.
5) We connect the resistor(220 ohms) acrros the led and the ground.
6) Using the PD3 pin , we connect it to the buzzer for turning it on/off.
7)
